# The Shelf

Welcome to **The Shelf**, a collection of random scripts, exploits, configs, and tools that I’ve accumulated over the years. Some are handy, some are niche, and most of them were created in the heat of competitive hacking. It’s a mixed bag—stuff that’s too small to justify its own repository but too useful to leave forgotten in a folder.


## Why "The Shelf"?

This repository exists for a few reasons:
- This is a way to clean up my secret gists and make these tools more accessible.
- These scripts and tools aren’t big enough for their own repositories, but they’re still useful.
- Some exploits just work, but they’re too small or specific to justify a full breakdown.
- Life’s easier when you don’t have to set things up repeatedly. These are some configs and tools I’ve tweaked to save time.


## What's Inside?

- **Tools**: From automations to random utilities.
- **Exploits**: Quick exploits written for specific targets that didn’t need a full breakdown or were created during CTFs.
- **Configs**: Lazy configs that make life easier.
- **CTF Tools**: Custom tools I use during competitive hacking. Some are rough, some are refined, but they all served their purpose.


## Why Share?

The thrill of hacking and pushing your limits is cool. But after the bloodthirst subsides, sharing knowledge is more powerful. There’s no need to hoard tools that could help someone else. Take what you need, adapt it!
