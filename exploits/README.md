### pwmdecrypt.py

This tool is designed to decrypt password vault files in `.pswm` format using a brute force attack with a wordlist. It attempts to decrypt the encrypted vault by trying each password from the specified wordlist (defaulting to `rockyou.txt`). Once successfully decrypted, it presents the contents in a well-formatted table showing the alias, username, and password.


#### Usage:
```bash
./pwm_decryptor.py <vault_file> -w <wordlist_path>
```

If no wordlist is specified, the tool defaults to `rockyou.txt`.
